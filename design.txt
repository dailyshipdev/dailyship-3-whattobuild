1) Base colors (90% of UI)

These reduce cognitive load and keep focus on content.

Background:        #0B0E14  (very dark blue/charcoal)
Surface / Cards:   #111827  (slate-900)
Border / Divider:  #1F2937  (slate-800)


Why:

Dark ≠ edgy here, it’s calm + focused

Cards feel like “workspaces”, not marketing

2) Primary accent (⚡ shipping energy)

Electric Amber / Yellow

Primary Accent:    #FACC15  (amber-400)
Hover Accent:      #EAB308  (amber-500)


Use this for:

⚡ CTA button (“Generate 3 Ideas Now”)

Icons (⚡, ⏱️)

Small highlights (counts: “20 seconds”, “60+ ideas”)

Why this works:

Yellow = speed, action, urgency

Strong contrast on dark

Feels productive, not playful (unlike neon green)

3) Secondary accent (quiet success state)

Soft Green (only for “done / copied”)

Success:           #22C55E  (green-500)


Use sparingly:

“Copied ✓”

Optional “Ready to ship” badge

Never use green for primary CTAs — it dilutes urgency.

4) Text colors (hierarchy is critical)
Primary text:      #E5E7EB  (gray-200)
Secondary text:    #9CA3AF  (gray-400)
Muted text:        #6B7280  (gray-500)


Rules:

Headlines: primary text

Descriptions: secondary

Labels / hints / tags: muted

This keeps the UI quiet and scannable.

Button styling (important)
Primary CTA
Background:   #FACC15
Text:         #0B0E14
Hover:        #EAB308
Radius:       rounded-xl


This button should visually scream:

“Click me. Something happens instantly.”

Secondary buttons (Regenerate, Copy)
Background:   transparent
Border:       #1F2937
Text:         #E5E7EB
Hover:        background #111827

Card styling (this matters a lot)

Cards should feel like tasks, not blog posts.

Background:   #111827
Border:       1px solid #1F2937
Radius:       rounded-2xl
Shadow:       very subtle (not floaty)


Accent usage inside cards:

Tags (30m, frontend) → amber text on dark pill

Section headers (“Scope”, “Ship Criteria”) → muted gray, uppercase, small

Never color bullets — let content breathe

Gradient? Yes — but ultra-subtle

Only one place:

Hero background (optional)
background: radial-gradient(
  circle at top,
  rgba(250,204,21,0.08),
  transparent 60%
);


This gives a hint of energy without looking like SaaS marketing.

What NOT to do (important)

❌ Neon green primary
❌ Purple / blue gradients
❌ More than one accent color
❌ Light mode first
❌ “Playful” illustrations

This is not a startup pitch deck — it’s a tool.
